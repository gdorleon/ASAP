## ASAP: Adaptive Set-Aside with Predictions [Accepted at ICDM'25 - RDM workshop]

This repository contains the paper describing **ASAP (Adaptive Set-Aside with Predictions)**, a learning-augmented online algorithm for proportional fairness in public-goods allocation.

ASAP combines a small guaranteed set-aside with prediction-guided greedy allocation and mirror-descent updates. It achieves near-optimal proportional fairness with accurate predictions and degrades gracefully under arbitrary prediction errors.
